## Introduction

UCC CYber Drill (UCCD) is a Capture The Flag framework focusing on ease of use and customizability.

UCCD comes with most of the features needed by an event organizer to run a competition or workshop. In addition, if UCC's feature set is insufficient, UCCD allows for the usage of plugins and themes to control almost every aspect of how it looks and behaves.

UCCD is used by many different clubs, universities, and companies to host their own Capture The Flags.

While available as open source, UCCD developers also provide a managed hosting service available at http://simulations.ug-cert.ug/.

UCCD is written in Python and makes use of the Flask web framework.
