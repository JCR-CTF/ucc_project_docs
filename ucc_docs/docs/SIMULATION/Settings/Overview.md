# Overview
CTFd allows organizers to change how the website looks to users through themes. Themes allow for significant changes in how the scoreboard, challenge board, user pages, team pages, etc. are all represented to the user.

# Customizing Themes
Basic Customization
In the /admin/config, you can add a logo, favicon, and change your theme's color.

You can also modify an existing theme in your CTFd instance by inserting JavaScript and CSS into the theme's header and footer.
