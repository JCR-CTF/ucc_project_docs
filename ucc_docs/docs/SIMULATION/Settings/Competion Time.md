# Competition Times

CTFd was originally designed to be used in time-boxed situations where users can only access the competition content during specific times. CTFd has four time settings: Start Time, End Time, Freeze Time, and pausing the competition.

# Start Time
Start Time defines when the competition should begin and all competition content should be accessible.
