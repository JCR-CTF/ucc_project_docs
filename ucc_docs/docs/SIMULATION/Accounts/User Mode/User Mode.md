# User Mode

## Overview

UCCD has two user modes that determine player registration and scoring:
* User Mode
* Team Mode

## Team Mode

In Team Mode:
* Every team needs a captain
* Captain registers the team and shares team password
* Team members join using team name and password

### Score Attribution
* All solves, submissions, awards, and hints are attributed to:
 * The individual user
 * The entire team

Think of it like basketball: when a player scores, both the player and team get credit for those points.

### Important Notes

* Registration Process:
 1. All players create individual user accounts
 2. Team captain creates team account
 3. Captain shares team credentials
 4. Team members join using shared credentials

* Solo players must still register a team to participate

## User Mode

Under User Mode:
* Participants play individually using their user account
* Multiple players can share one account
* All activity (solves/submissions) is attributed to the shared account
* No breakdown of individual player contributions
