# Requirements

CTFd supports challenges that cannot be seen/interacted with until a prerequisite challenge has been solved.

## Purpose
Challenge requirements can be used to create trees of challenges that users must go through to accomplish everything.

## Display Options
Admins can control how locked challenges appear:
* Anonymize challenges until unlocked
* Hide challenges completely
