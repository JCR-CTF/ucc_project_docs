# Requirements

UCCD supports challenges that cannot be seen/interacted with until a prerequisite challenge has been solved.

Challenge requirements can be used to create trees of challenges that users must go through to accomplish everything.

Admins can also choose whether to anonymize the challenge if it hasn't been unlocked or to hide the challenge completely.
