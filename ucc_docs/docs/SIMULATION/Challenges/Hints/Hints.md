# Hints

UCCD allows admins to create hints which can be unlocked by users.

## Hint Costs and Scoring

### Paid Hints
* Hints can have an associated point cost
* Users must have enough points to unlock paid hints
* Point cost is deducted from user's total score upon unlocking
* User score cannot go below zero

### Example:
* Challenge hint costs 50 points
* User has 300 points
* After unlocking hint: 300 - 50 = 250 points remaining

## Strategy Recommendations

### Initial Points Setup
* Create an introductory "gimme" challenge
* Provides initial points to users
* Enables hint unlocking for later challenges

> **Caution**: In online CTFs, users can create multiple accounts. Paid hints may not effectively control point deduction as users could:
> * Create throwaway accounts to view hints
> * Apply hint knowledge to their main account
> * Bypass the point deduction system
