The Challenges Creation feature allows instructors to design and add new challenges to the LMS, promoting active learning and skill development. Key steps in creating challenges include:

## Key Features

* **Define Challenge Details:** Instructors specify the challenge name, description, and objectives, giving users a clear understanding of the task.

* **Set Difficulty Level:** Assigning a difficulty level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced) helps users select challenges that match their skill level.

* **Configure Access and Prerequisites:** Instructors can set prerequisites or conditions, such as requiring completion of previous challenges or specific role access.

* **Add Scoring and Feedback:** Define points, scoring criteria, and feedback options to provide users with meaningful performance metrics.
