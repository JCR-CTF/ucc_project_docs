UCC Cyber Range is a Capture The Flag framework focusing on ease of use and customizability.

UCC Cyber Range comes with most of the features needed by an event organizer to run a competition or workshop. In addition, if UCC Cyber Range's feature set is insufficient, UCC Cyber Range allows for the usage of plugins and themes to control almost every aspect of how it looks and behaves.

UCC Cyber Range is used by many different clubs, universities, and companies to host their own Capture The Flags.

While available as open source, UCC Cyber Range developers also provide a managed hosting service available at [UCC-Simulation](http://simulations.ug-cert.ug).

UCC Cyber Range is written in Python and makes use of the Flask web framework.
