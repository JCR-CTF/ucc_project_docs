# Enrolment

The enrollment feature allows users to register for courses within the LMS. This process can vary based on course requirements and user roles (e.g., student, instructor, admin). Key enrollment options typically include:

* **Self-Enrollment:** Users can directly enroll in available courses by selecting them.
* **Admin Enrollment:** Admins can assign users to specific courses, ideal for mandatory or restricted-access content.
* **Enrollment Codes:** Course-specific codes enable restricted access, where only users with the correct code can join.
* **Batch Enrollment:** Admins can upload a list of users to enroll multiple users at once.
Each enrollment type may be configured to suit specific organizational needs.
