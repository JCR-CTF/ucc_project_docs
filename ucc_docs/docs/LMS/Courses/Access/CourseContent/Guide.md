# Enrolment and Assignment

**Enrolment**

Content for Enrolment goes here.
The enrollment feature allows users to register for courses within the LMS. This process can vary based on course requirements and user roles (e.g., student, instructor, admin). Key enrollment options typically include:
* **Self-Enrollment:** Users can directly enroll in available courses by selecting them.
* **Admin Enrollment:** Admins can assign users to specific courses, ideal for mandatory or restricted-access content.
* **Enrollment Codes:** Course-specific codes enable restricted access, where only users with the correct code can join.
* **Batch Enrollment:** Admins can upload a list of users to enroll multiple users at once.
Each enrollment type may be configured to suit specific organizational needs.

**Assignment**

Assignments allow instructors to create and manage coursework for students. Assignments can include written responses, file uploads, or multimedia submissions, with configurable due dates and grading criteria.
# Feedback
Feedback provides instructors with a way to give personalized responses to each studentâ€™s submission. Feedback can include comments, grades, and attachments, helping students understand their performance and areas for improvement.
# Availability
Availability settings determine when an assignment is accessible to students. Instructors can set specific open and close dates to control when students can view and submit their work.
# Notifications
Notifications keep users informed of important updates. Students receive alerts about upcoming due dates, assignment openings, and grades, ensuring they stay on track. Instructors can also receive notifications when submissions are received.
# Submission Settings
Submission settings allow instructors to specify the format and conditions for submitting assignments. This can include file types, word limits, single or multiple attempts, and any requirements for finalizing submissions.
